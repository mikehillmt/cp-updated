# ClickCampaigns for Claude Code

> Build production-ready marketing campaigns entirely inside Claude Code, Cursor, or any AI coding agent.

**Alex**, your AI Campaign Manager, coordinates a team of 22 marketing specialists to create complete campaign assets: HTML funnel pages, email sequences, VSL scripts, ad copy, webinar slide decks, lead magnet PDFs, and more — all from natural language requests.

---

## What This Is

ClickCampaigns is a **prompt engineering framework** packaged as a portable project folder. Drop it into any AI coding environment (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI) and you get:

- **22 specialized marketing agents** with detailed personas, backstories, and expertise areas
- **26 funnel types** with complete implementation skill files
- **25+ task categories** covering every marketing channel
- **Production skills** for generating HTML, PowerPoint, PDF, and Word documents
- **First-run setup wizard** — configures for solo marketers or agencies
- **Client/campaign organization** with brand kit management
- **Image integration** via Pexels (stock photos) and Google Gemini (AI-generated images)
- **Clone Page** — scrape any webpage into a self-contained HTML file with Firecrawl
- **HTML-to-PDF** — convert any HTML page to pixel-perfect PDF with Playwright's Chromium engine

No SaaS subscription. No API beyond optional image generation and page cloning. Everything runs locally through your AI coding tool.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone or Copy the Folder

Place the `ClickCampaigns-for-Claude-Code-in-Cursor/` folder anywhere on your machine.

### 2. Install Dependencies (Optional — for image generation, PDF, and page cloning)

```bash
cd .engine && npm run setup
cp .engine/.env.example .engine/.env
# Add your API keys to .engine/.env:
#   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key    (AI image generation)
#   PEXELS_API_KEY=your-key    (stock photo search)
#   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-key (Clone Page feature)
```

This installs npm packages and Playwright's Chromium browser (used for HTML-to-PDF conversion).

### 3. Open in Your AI Coding Tool

- **Claude Code**: Open the folder — `CLAUDE.md` loads automatically
- **Codex**: Open the folder — `AGENTS.md` loads automatically and points to `CLAUDE.md`
- **Cursor**: Open the folder and add `CLAUDE.md` as a project rule
- **Other AI agents**: Have the agent read `CLAUDE.md` at the start of each session

### 4. First-Time Setup

On first launch, Alex asks two questions:

1. **How will you use ClickCampaigns?**
   - **Business/Marketer (Solo mode)** — campaigns at the root, no client folders needed
   - **Agency mode** — each client gets their own folder with brand files and campaigns

2. **Do you use Obsidian for Markdown?** — enables YAML frontmatter and callout syntax if yes

Alex configures the project automatically. This only happens once.

### 5. Start Working

```
"Create a campaign called 'Summer Launch'. I need a product launch funnel with
webinar registration, sales page, checkout, and a 12-email launch sequence."
```

---

## How It Works

### The Alex Orchestration Model

Alex (Campaign Manager) acts as the central coordinator. When you request work:

1. **Setup/Selection** — On first run, Alex asks about your workflow (solo vs agency). Then each session: solo mode asks about campaigns, agency mode asks about clients
2. **Brand Context** — Alex loads brand knowledge base and style guide
3. **Specialist Assignment** — Alex delegates to the right specialist(s) based on the work type
4. **Asset Creation** — Specialists follow their SKILL.md files with Ryan's direct response copy principles always active
5. **Copy Review** — Single-pass copy critique applied as diffs to the same file (no draft/final split), with design lock for HTML pages
6. **Consistency Check** — Cross-asset pass standardizes guarantees, pricing, dates, and offer names across all campaign assets
7. **File Output** — Everything saves to the organized `output-assets/` folder structure

### The Ryan Layer

Ryan's direct response copywriting principles are permanently loaded into every specialist who touches copy — not as a separate handoff, but as a permanent lens. After each asset is created, a single-pass copy review runs and changes are applied as diffs to the same file.

### Five Core Workflows

| Workflow | Who Leads | What It Produces |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **A: Non-HTML Direct Response** | Ryan (Copywriter) + copy review | Email sequences, ad copy, VSL scripts as Markdown |
| **B: Short HTML Pages** | Cassidy (Designer) with Ryan's lens + copy review + design lock | Landing pages, opt-ins, thank-you pages |
| **C: Long-Form HTML Pages** | Ryan (Copywriter) → Cassidy designs with Ryan's lens + copy review + design lock | Sales pages, VSL pages, checkout pages |
| **D: Webinar Slides** | Tyler (Webinar) with Ryan's lens + copy review → Cassidy designs | Scripts + PPTX/HTML slide decks |
| **E: Lead Magnets & Books** | Kendall (Ghostwriter) with Ryan's lens + copy review → Lena designs | PDFs, DOCX, guides, books |

## Brand Kit System

Your brand kit provides context for all generated assets.

### Brand Knowledge Base
Captures your business identity — story, audience, offer, voice, differentiators, credibility, and competitive positioning. This drives the **copy** in every asset.

### Brand Style Guide
Captures your visual identity — colors, fonts, imagery style, brand personality. This drives the **design** of HTML pages, PDFs, and presentations.

### Template Files
Start from the included templates:
- [.engine/templates/brand-knowledge-base-template.md](.engine/templates/brand-knowledge-base-template.md)
- [.engine/templates/brand-style-guide-template.md](.engine/templates/brand-style-guide-template.md)

### Brand File Locations

| Level | Solo Mode | Agency Mode |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Shared** | `brand-kit/` (project root) | `clients/[client]/brand-kit/` |
| **Campaign override** | `campaigns/[campaign]/brand-kit/` | `clients/[client]/campaigns/[campaign]/brand-kit/` |

Alex checks both levels and uses campaign-specific files when present.

---

## Styling System

The brand knowledge base is **always used for copy**. The brand style guide is used selectively based on asset type:

| Asset Type | Default Style | Alex Asks? | Rationale |
|------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Funnel pages** | Direct response | Yes | Conversion > aesthetics |
| **Brand websites** | Full brand | No | Brand representation |
| **Presentations** | Professional + brand hints | Yes | Focus on speaker |
| **Lead magnets / PDFs** | Full brand | No | Credibility pieces |
| **Books** | Full brand | No | Authority assets |
| **Emails** | Minimal / plain text | No | Deliverability |

### Funnel Page Design Options

For funnel pages, Alex asks three questions:

**1. Styling approach:**
- **Direct response style** (recommended) — proven conversion patterns, high-contrast CTAs
- **Full brand style guide** — match corporate look
- **DR with brand hints** — DR patterns + brand colors/fonts

**2. Design era** (if direct response or brand hints):
- **Classic ClickFunnels** — traditional 2015-2020 aesthetic (white backgrounds, bold ALL CAPS headlines, bright red/orange/green CTAs, yellow urgency highlights, "As Seen On" bars, thick borders)
- **Modern Premium** — contemporary 2024+ aesthetic (elegant serif + sans-serif typography, gradient CTA buttons, subtle urgency, generous whitespace, soft card shadows)

**3. Theme** (if Modern Premium):
- **Dark theme** — dark backgrounds, light text, dramatic feel
- **Light theme** — light backgrounds, dark text, accessible feel

---

## Production Skills

Production skills ensure high-quality final output. Available as both skill files (any AI agent) and Claude Code slash commands.

| Asset Type | Skill File | Claude Code Command |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Funnel/landing pages** (templated) | `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/page-design/SKILL.md` | `/page-design` |
| **Bespoke HTML/UI** (from scratch) | `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/frontend-design/SKILL.md` | `/frontend-design` |
| **Copy critique** | `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/copy-critique/SKILL.md` | — |
| **PowerPoint decks** | `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/pptx/SKILL.md` | `/pptx` |
| **PDF documents** | `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/pdf/SKILL.md` | `/pdf` |
| **Word documents** | `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/docx/SKILL.md` | `/docx` |

### How Skills Work Together

- **Marketing skills** (`.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/funnels/`, `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/tasks/`) = **WHAT** to write (frameworks, structure, persuasion)
- **Production skills** (`.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/`) = **HOW** to output it (design, formatting, file generation)
- **Copy critique** (`.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/copy-critique/`) = **QUALITY** — single-pass direct response review applied to every asset

### Example: Building a Sales Page

1. Read the marketing skill: `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/funnels/vsl-hybrid/SKILL.md`
2. Ryan writes the copy following direct response principles
3. Read the production skill: `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/page-design/SKILL.md` and pick a matching template (browse the gallery `index.html`)
4. Cassidy fills the template's `{{placeholders}}` with the copy and brand styling, producing production-quality static HTML

---

## HTML Standards

Funnel/landing pages are **framework-free static HTML** — single self-contained files that load fast and deploy anywhere with no build step. Start from the **`page-design`** template library (40 templates) rather than building from scratch.

### House structure

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>{{PAGE_TITLE}}</title>
  <!-- At most ONE Google Font, with display=swap and a system fallback -->
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <style>
    /* All CSS inline. Brand via custom properties — change these to rebrand the page. */
    :root{
      --accent:#E8590C; --text:#1A1A2E; --bg:#FFFFFF;
      --font:'Inter',-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,'Segoe UI',sans-serif;
    }
    /* ...page styles... */
  </style>
</head>
```

- **No CSS frameworks** (no Tailwind, no Bootstrap). No icon font — use inline SVG.
- **Minimal JS**, inline, and only when functionally required (countdown, form validation, quiz).
- Icons: inline `<svg>` (the templates already include the SVGs they need).

### Placeholders

Library templates ship with `{{UPPER_SNAKE_CASE}}` tokens (`{{HEADLINE}}`, `{{CTA_TEXT}}`, `{{PRICE}}`, …). When you generate a real page you **replace every token** — a delivered page contains **zero** `{{ }}`.

### Quality Standards

- **Mobile-first / responsive** — works on all devices
- **Self-contained** — single HTML file, no build step
- **Real content** — all placeholders filled; Pexels URLs (or generated images) for stock photos
- **Fast** — inline CSS, lazy images, HTML under ~50KB
- **Production-ready** — deploy immediately

> _Legacy:_ `templates/page-templates/modern-dark-course-sales.html` predates this standard and uses Tailwind v4 CDN + Lucide; it's a labeled exception pending conversion.

---

## Image Integration

Two image sources are available for campaign assets:

| Source | Best For | Speed |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Pexels** (stock photos) | Hero images, backgrounds, lifestyle shots | Instant |
| **Gemini** (AI-generated) | Custom branded visuals, specific scenes, product mockups | 15-20 sec |

### Usage

**Search Pexels for stock photos:**
```bash
node .engine/scripts/pexels-search.js "business team celebrating" 5
```
Returns URLs you can use directly in HTML/CSS.

**Generate AI image with Gemini:**
```bash
# Path depends on your mode (solo or agency):
node .engine/scripts/generate-image.js "Professional team in modern office" campaigns/[campaign]/output-assets/images/hero.png
```
Saves image file to specified path.

### Assets That Need Images

| Asset Type | Typical Images |
|------------|----------------|
| **Landing pages** | Hero image, background |
| **Sales pages** | Hero, testimonial photos, product shots |
| **PDFs / Lead magnets** | Cover image, chapter headers, illustrations |
| **Presentations** | Slide backgrounds, icons, diagrams |
| **Ad creatives** | Primary image for each ad variation |

---

## Clone Page

Clone any existing webpage into a self-contained HTML file. Uses [Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) to scrape the page, embed all CSS inline, remove tracking scripts, and extract the site's branding.

**Requires:** `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` in `.engine/.env`

```bash
# Solo mode:
node .engine/scripts/clone-page.js "https://example.com/sales-page" campaigns/[campaign]/output-assets/html/cloned-page.html

# Agency mode:
node .engine/scripts/clone-page.js "https://example.com/sales-page" clients/[client]/campaigns/[campaign]/output-assets/html/cloned-page.html
```

**What it produces:**
- **`cloned-page.html`** — Self-contained HTML with all CSS embedded, images as absolute URLs, tracking scripts removed
- **`cloned-page-branding.md`** — Extracted brand analysis (colors, fonts, typography, button styles)

**Use cases:**
- Clone a competitor's page as a starting point, then rewrite the copy with your brand voice
- Study a page's design system via the branding report
- Use a great layout as a structural template for your own funnel

---

## HTML to PDF

Convert any HTML page into a professional PDF using Playwright's Chromium engine. This is the **highest-quality approach** for lead magnets, branded reports, eBooks, and any document where design matters — full CSS support including flexbox, grid, custom fonts, gradients, and shadows.

```bash
# Basic conversion:
node .engine/scripts/html-to-pdf.js campaigns/[campaign]/output-assets/html/lead-magnet.html

# Custom output path:
node .engine/scripts/html-to-pdf.js input.html output.pdf

# With options:
node .engine/scripts/html-to-pdf.js input.html output.pdf --page-numbers --letter
node .engine/scripts/html-to-pdf.js input.html output.pdf --landscape --no-margin --scale=0.8
```

**Options:** `--landscape`, `--letter` (US Letter vs A4), `--no-margin`, `--scale=N`, `--header="text"`, `--footer="text"`, `--page-numbers`, `--no-background`, `--wait=N`

**One-time setup:** `npx playwright install chromium` (included in `cd .engine && npm run setup`)

**Workflow:** Alex's team builds beautiful HTML/CSS first (Kendall writes, Lena designs), then converts to PDF — the PDF inherits all the styling.

## Workflow Details

### Workflow A: Non-HTML Direct Response

**Emails, ad copy, VSL scripts, sales letters (as documents)**

Ryan (Direct Response Copywriter) creates the asset with his principles baked in:
1. Ryan writes the copy → Markdown document

Cassidy (Website Designer) creates the page with Ryan's copy principles loaded:
1. For funnel pages, ask about styling first
2. Cassidy creates HTML with strong copy from the start (Ryan's principles baked in)
3. Single-pass copy review — apply improvements as diffs to the same file
4. Design lock — verify copy changes haven't broken layout or responsive behavior

**Output files:**
- `html/[page-name].html` — The finished page (copy already refined)
- `documents/[page-name]-copy-critique.md` — What was changed and why (user reference)

**Pages using this workflow:** Opt-in pages, webinar registration, thank you pages, simple checkout, about pages, contact pages

### Workflow C: Long-Form HTML Pages (Copy-First)

**Sales pages, VSL pages, and any page with substantial persuasion copy**

Ryan (Copywriter) leads, Cassidy (Designer) implements with Ryan's principles loaded:
1. Ryan writes complete copy first → Markdown document (4,000-10,000+ words)
2. Cassidy designs HTML around the copy with Ryan's principles still active
3. Single-pass copy review → apply final improvements as diffs
4. Design lock — verify copy changes haven't broken layout

**Output files:**
- `documents/[page-name]-copy.md` — Ryan's full copy document
- `html/[page-name].html` — The finished designed page (copy already refined)
- `documents/[page-name]-copy-critique.md` — What was changed and why (user reference)

**Pages using this workflow:** Long-form sales pages, VSL pages with sales copy below, checkout pages with full offer copy, upsell/downsell pages

### Workflow D: Webinar Slides

**Webinar presentations with script**

Tyler (Webinar Specialist) leads with Ryan's principles loaded, Cassidy designs:
1. Tyler writes the complete webinar script (50+ slides with speaker notes, Ryan's persuasion baked in)
2. Single-pass copy review → apply improvements as diffs to the script
3. Alex asks about format (PPTX, HTML, or both) and styling
4. Cassidy designs the slide deck (5 words max per slide rule)

**Output files:**
- `documents/webinar-script.md` — Full script with speaker notes (copy already refined)
- `presentations/webinar-slides.pptx` — PowerPoint (if chosen)
- `html/webinar-slides.html` — HTML Reveal.js slides (if chosen)

### Workflow E: Lead Magnets & Books

**PDFs, guides, checklists, workbooks, reports, and books**

Kendall (Book Ghostwriter) leads with Ryan's principles loaded, Lena (Graphic Designer) designs:
1. Kendall writes the complete content (Ryan's persuasion for headlines, CTAs, key takeaways)
2. Single-pass copy review → apply improvements as diffs
3. Alex asks: "Do you want PDF, DOCX (editable), or both?"
4. Lena designs the formatted document using full Brand Style Guide

**Asset types:** Freemium PDF guides, checklists and workbooks, research reports, MVB (30-50 pages), short books (50-100 pages), full books (100-200+ pages)

**Output files:**
- `documents/[asset-name]-content.md` — Full content (copy already refined)

**Option 1: Live Server Extension (Recommended)**
Install the "Live Server" extension by ritwickdey in VS Code/Cursor. Right-click any HTML file → "Open with Live Server" for auto-refresh on save.

**Option 2: Node.js Server**
```bash
# Solo mode:
npx serve campaigns/[campaign-name]/output-assets/html
# Agency mode:
npx serve clients/[client-name]/campaigns/[campaign-name]/output-assets/html
```

**Option 3: Open Directly**
Double-click the HTML file in Finder — works fine since all files are self-contained.

## Compatibility

| AI Coding Tool | Auto-Reads | Setup |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | Just open the folder — works immediately |
| **Cursor** | `.cursorrules` | Add `CLAUDE.md` as a project rule, or read it at session start |
| **Codex (OpenAI)** | `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` loads automatically and points to `CLAUDE.md` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `GEMINI.md` | Have agent read `CLAUDE.md` at session start |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurfrules` | Have agent read `CLAUDE.md` at session start |
| **Any AI agent** | Varies | Point the agent to read `CLAUDE.md` first |

### How the Instruction Files Work

| File | Purpose | Who reads it |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **`CLAUDE.md`** | AI agent instructions — starts as setup wizard, then configured for your mode | All tools (directly or via pointer) |
| **`AGENTS.md`** | Pointer file — tells agents to check setup and read `CLAUDE.md` | Codex and tools that look for AGENTS.md |
| **`.clickcampaigns.json`** | Configuration file — stores mode (solo/agency) and preferences | Created during setup, read by agents |
| **`.engine/setup/templates/`** | Mode-specific templates — used during setup and mode switching | Read by agents during setup only |
| **`README.md`** | Human-facing documentation (this file) | Developers on GitHub |

The system is AI-tool agnostic — the intelligence lives in the skill files and agent personas, not in any specific platform. `CLAUDE.md` is the canonical instruction set regardless of which tool you use.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional | AI image generation via Google Gemini |
| `PEXELS_API_KEY` | Optional | Stock photo search via Pexels API |
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` | Optional | Clone Page feature (scrape any webpage) |

All API keys are optional. Core functionality (copy, funnels, emails, ads) works without any keys.
