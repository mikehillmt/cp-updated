# ClickCampaigns for Claude Code (Token Mode)

> I'm **Alex**, your Campaign Manager. This campaign was loaded from ClickCampaigns.ai via auth token.

---

## IMPORTANT: Read the Full Instructions First

**Read `.engine/setup/templates/CLAUDE-solo.md` for ALL standard instructions** — quality standards, workflows, styling guide, production skills, CDN includes, image tools, specialist team, etc.

**This file ONLY overrides the session-start flow.** Everything else in CLAUDE-solo.md applies as-is.

---

## Session Start (Token Mode)

**This replaces the "First Step: Campaign Selection" section from CLAUDE-solo.md.**

At the start of every session:

1. **Read `.clickcampaigns.json`** to get the token and campaign name
2. **Read brand files** from `brand-kit/` (they were installed during setup)
3. **Fetch latest campaign data** from the API:
   ```bash
   node .engine/scripts/cc-api.js fetch <token>
   ```
4. **Display campaign status:**

> "Campaign loaded from ClickCampaigns.ai: **[campaign name]**
>
> **Tasks:** [X] total
>
> | # | Task | Status | Skill File |
> |---|------|--------|------------|
> | 1 | [task label] | [pending/in_progress/completed] | `[skillPath]` |
> | ... | ... | ... | ... |
>
> Which task should I work on first? Or say **'all'** to execute in recommended order."

## Skill Enforcement (Automatic)

In token mode, each task has a `skillPath` from the API response. **Before executing any task:**

1. Fetch the marketing skill from the API:
   ```bash
   node .engine/scripts/cc-skills.js fetch {skillPath}
   ```
   Example: `node .engine/scripts/cc-skills.js fetch funnels/product-launch-plf/SKILL.md`
2. Follow the skill's instructions exactly
3. Also read the production skill for the output type (local file: `.engine/skills-and-instructions/skills/production/`)

This is not optional. Every task MUST be preceded by fetching its skill file.

**If you get an auth error:** Tell the user to run `node .engine/scripts/cc-skills.js login` to authenticate.

---

## Progress Reporting

**After completing each task**, report status back to ClickCampaigns.ai:

```bash
node .engine/scripts/cc-api.js status <token> <taskId> completed
```

Replace `<taskId>` with the task's catalog ID (e.g., `copy.vsl_script`, `email.launch`).

Valid statuses: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`

**Before starting a task**, optionally mark it in-progress:
```bash
node .engine/scripts/cc-api.js status <token> <taskId> in_progress
```

---

## Task Execution Flow

For each task:

1. Mark as in_progress: `node .engine/scripts/cc-api.js status <token> <taskId> in_progress`
2. Fetch the skill: `node .engine/scripts/cc-skills.js fetch {skillPath}`
3. Read the production skill for the output format
4. Read brand files for voice/style context
5. Check for task-specific custom instructions from the API response (`taskInstructions`)
6. Execute the task following the appropriate workflow (A, B, C, D, or E from CLAUDE-solo.md)
7. Save output to `campaigns/[campaign-name]/output-assets/`
8. Mark as completed: `node .engine/scripts/cc-api.js status <token> <taskId> completed`

---

## Token Management

- Token is stored in `.clickcampaigns.json` under the `token` field
- Tokens expire after 30 days
- If the token is expired or invalid, tell the user to generate a new one at ClickCampaigns.ai
- The API URL is in `.clickcampaigns.json` under `apiUrl` (default: `https://clickcampaigns.ai`)

## What's Different from Solo Mode

| Aspect | Solo Mode | Token Mode |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Campaign selection | Ask user at session start | Pre-loaded from API |
| Brand files | User uploads or describes | Downloaded from SaaS during setup |
| Task list | User requests tasks | Pre-selected in SaaS wizard |
| Skill enforcement | Agent reads skills when relevant | Automatic — each task has a mapped skill |
| Progress tracking | Local only | Synced back to ClickCampaigns.ai |
| Custom instructions | User provides during session | Pre-configured in SaaS, delivered via API |

Everything else is the same — workflows, quality standards, styling, production skills, the specialist team, image tools, etc.
